Abstract
Anomaly Detection in Network Intrusion Data using Unsupervised Learning
In the domain of cybersecurity, the timely detection of anomalous network activities is paramount for safeguarding digital assets. This project addresses the critical challenge of identifying unusual and potentially malicious patterns within network traffic by leveraging unsupervised learning, specifically the Isolation Forest algorithm. The UNSW-NB15 dataset, a comprehensive collection of real modern normal activities and synthetic attack behaviors, serves as the foundation for this study.

The methodology encompasses rigorous data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical attributes to prepare the data for modeling. The Isolation Forest model is then trained on this clean, unlabeled dataset to identify outliers based on their unique characteristics. The project involves predicting anomaly scores and binary anomaly labels, followed by an in-depth analysis of the detected anomalies. This includes examining the distribution of anomaly scores, presenting samples of flagged connections, and performing a crucial qualitative assessment against the dataset's original ground truth labels to understand which known attack categories, as well as 'normal' instances, are identified as anomalous. Visualizations, such as anomaly score histograms and feature-space scatter plots, further aid in interpreting the model's findings.

The outcome of this project demonstrates the Isolation Forest's efficacy in autonomously uncovering both known network intrusions and previously unseen, unusual behaviors that warrant further investigation. This capability is vital for enhancing proactive threat intelligence and potentially detecting zero-day attacks in real-world network security operations.

Network Anomaly Detection using Isolation Forest
This project implements an unsupervised anomaly detection system for network intrusion data using the Isolation Forest algorithm.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Name: UNSW-NB15 Dataset

Source: UNSW Canberra Cybersecurity (Requires download of training and testing CSV files)

Features Used: All network traffic features (42 columns after dropping id, label, and attack_cat for unsupervised training).

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation

numpy for numerical operations

matplotlib for plotting

seaborn for statistical data visualization

scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms (specifically IsolationForest, LabelEncoder, StandardScaler)

ðŸ“ˆ Methodology
Data Loading & Combination: Load UNSW_NB15_training-set.csv and UNSW_NB15_testing-set.csv and combine them into a single DataFrame.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values (fill with 0 for numerical, 'unknown' for categorical).

Drop non-feature columns (id, label, attack_cat) from the training data.

Encode categorical features using LabelEncoder.

Scale numerical features using StandardScaler.

Isolation Forest Model Implementation:

Initialize and train the IsolationForest model on the preprocessed, unlabeled data.

The contamination parameter (set to 0.01) estimates the proportion of anomalies in the dataset.

Anomaly Score & Label Prediction:

Generate anomaly scores using model.decision_function().

Predict anomaly labels (-1 for anomaly, 1 for normal) using model.predict().

Analysis of Detected Anomalies:

Analyze the distribution of anomaly labels (-1 vs 1).

Perform a qualitative assessment by mapping detected anomalies back to their original attack_cat labels to see which known attack types were flagged.

Visualization:

Histogram of anomaly scores, showing the calculated anomaly threshold.

Scatter plot of key features (sbytes vs dbytes) highlighting normal vs. anomalous points, using symmetric logarithmic scales for better visualization of wide-ranging values.

ðŸ“Œ Results
Successfully identified anomalous network connections within the UNSW-NB15 dataset.

The model detected a significant number of known attack types (e.g., Exploits, Fuzzers, DoS) as anomalies, validating its effectiveness.

Notably, the model also flagged "Normal" instances as anomalous, which could represent rare legitimate behaviors or potentially novel, unseen threats.

Visualizations provide clear insights into the distribution of anomaly scores and the separation of anomalous points in feature space.

The project demonstrates the practical application of unsupervised learning for enhancing network security threat intelligence.
